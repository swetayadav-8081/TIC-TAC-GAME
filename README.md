# TIC-TAC-GAME
Tic-tac-toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a simple game for two players where they take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win.
